NEURALINK (Jean-Jonathan)

Hello I am going to tell you about an incredible technology that will change the world. This is
NEURALINK technology.
Elon Musk invented an electronic chip to implant it in the human brain. Thanks to this chip, humans
will be able to remotely control computers or mobile phones using Artificial Intelligence.
But beyond the brain's communication with electronic objects, this chip has the ambition to treat
humans of certain neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.
In addition, this chip allows people who are very paralyzed following an accident to regain the use of
their limb.
Elon Musk also announced that with this chip, people go back to their past to relive their memories.
For the moment this chip has been implanted on animals, in particular a monkey and several guinea
pig pigs.
Finally, the results were up to the engineers' expectations. They will consider testig this chip on
humans in this year.
Thank you for listening to me.


AEKLYS (Colas NAUDI)

I'm going to introduce you to a technology that is not very used today, but which I think is a trendy future technology. Its name is AEKLYS, it is a jewel that looks like a ring, but which is very useful in everyday life unlike a simple ring. It is connected and can be used as a contactless payment card by first entering your card in the dedicated application. In addition, it also serves as a pass to access certain things such as unlocking your computer, opening your front door ...
This ring embeds NFC technology, it is a technology that allows the exchange of information between two devices via contactless. If your computer has a way to unlock it via NFC, it will be much faster than entering your password.
But also, to take transport, instead of constantly looking for your bus card, it will be recorded in the ring and will allow you to validate your trip just by passing your ring on the terminal. It's a revolution for all these things, but especially for one, is that it doesn't need to be charge. No, you don't have to have a new charger yet and put it to charge every night. It is a technology of tomorrow that is still very affordable and very aesthetic.
